### Other Improvements/Bug fixes
* CA setup can now delete logs older than 30 days. This number can be overwritten in application settings of the CA function app by defining the number in ```DeleteLogsOlderThanDays```. This feature can be disabled by setting ```DisableLogsCleanup``` environment variable to False.
* CSV report generated now provides an "AdditionalInfo" column with details specific to resource getting scanned
* The ```Get-AzSKADOSecurityStatusBatchMode``` (gadsbm) command now supports scanning pipelines from multiple projects in batch mode.
* In ```-IncrementalScan``` feature fixed an issue with ```-IncrementalDate``` switch. The switch now supports time of the day along with date in CA mode to scan pipelines modified after the specified time only.
* ```IncrementalScan``` now supports partial commits as well. In case of a partial scan, pipelines that are yet to be scanned from previous checkpoints will be scanned first before attempting to enter into incremental mode.
* ```IncrementalScan``` now scans those pipelines as well whose RBAC permissions have been changed. 
* The GADS command now supports scanning of any combination of resources in addition to scanning all artifacts. Using the resource type ``` -rtn Build_Release_SvcConn_AgentPool_VarGroup_User_CommonSVTResources```, you can specify the resource names to be scanned in any combination.
* Fixed the issue with ```â€“DoNotRefetchResources``` when multiple projects are scanned.
* Performance improvements has been done for pre scan processing which reduces the significant amount of time in fetching and generating the SVT's before starting the scan
* GADI Inventory now supports common SVT controls
* Disabled attestation error message in case if attestation is not enabled for org controls.
* Scan report folder name will come with UBC/UPC/TAG/SVCBasedScan if any of these used in GADS command.
* Count of Agent pools displayed via ```GADI -infotype OrganizationInfo -ProjectNames $projName``` will not include legacy agent pools.
