# 210615 (AzSK.ADO v.1.8.0)

## Feature Updates

### ADO Security Scanner PowerShell Module:
* Local folder-based org policy support:
    * To facilitate use of ADO Scanner locally (from desktop console) for driving compliance for an org, we have added support to run against org policy (custom control settings, etc.) from a local folder. This capability can be used by org/project admins to evaluate ADO Scanner and fine tune its configuration for their org/environment before deploying the org policy as a policy repo.
    * Command to configure a local folder as source of org policy:
        ```PowerShell
        Set-AzSKADOPolicySettings -LocalOrgPolicyFolderPath $folderpath
        ```
    * To reset the org policy to default location: 
        ```PowerShell
        Set-AzSKADOPolicySettings -RestoreDefaultOrgPolicySettings
        ```

*   Common SVT class for one-off controls: 
    * Added support for a common class that can be used to scan one-off controls (e.g., if we want to check just one setting for all feeds as opposed to several controls on each feed object). This approach is more memory efficient and useful when scanning large organizations/projects.
    * In this release, we have added controls for Feeds, Repositories and Secure Files that use this model. 

### Security controls updates
* New controls:
    Several new controls were added as an outcome of refactoring controls to split potential long tail controls into more addressable components. (As an example, for the ‘review-and-remove-guest-users’ control, we have a smaller and more actionable ‘remove-inactive-guest-users’ control which flags guest members not seen active for a configurable threshold period.)
    * ```ADO_Organization_AuthZ_Revoke_Admin_Access_for_Guest_Users``` - Remove guest users from administrative roles in your organization.
    * ```ADO_Organization_AuthZ_Revoke_Admin_Access_for_Inactive_Users``` - Remove inactive users from administrative roles in your organization.
    * ```ADO_Project_AuthZ_Revoke_Admin_Access_for_Guest_Users``` - Remove guest users from administrative roles in your project.
    * ```ADO_Project_AuthZ_Revoke_Admin_Access_for_Inactive_Users``` -  Remove inactive users from administrative roles in your project.
    * ```ADO_Project_AuthZ_Restrict_Broader_Group_Access_on_Builds``` - Do not allow build pipelines to inherit excessive permissions for a broad group of users at project level.
    * ```ADO_Project_AuthZ_Restrict_Broader_Group_Access_on_Releases``` - Do not allow release pipelines to inherit excessive permissions for a broad group of users at project level.
    * ```ADO_Project_AuthZ_Restrict_Broader_Group_Access_on_SvcConn``` - Do not allow service connections to inherit excessive permissions for a broad group of users at project level.
    * ```ADO_Project_AuthZ_Restrict_Broader_Group_Access_on_Agentpool``` - Do not allow agent pools to inherit excessive permissions for a broad group of users at project level.
    * ```ADO_Project_AuthZ_Restrict_Broader_Group_Access_on_VarGrp``` - Do not allow variable groups to inherit excessive permissions for a broad group of users at project level.
    * ```ADO_VariableGroup_AuthZ_Restrict_Broader_Group_Access``` - Broader groups (contributors, project valid users, etc.) should not have administrator privileges on variable group.
    * ```ADO_Repository_DP_Inactive_Repos``` - Inactive repositories must be removed if no more required.
    * ```ADO_Feed_AuthZ_Restrict_Permissions``` - Do not allow a broad group of users to upload packages to feed.
    * ```ADO_SecureFile_AuthZ_Dont_Grant_All_Pipelines_Access``` - Do not make secure files accessible to all pipelines.

* Changes to existing controls:
    * The ```ADO_Build_DP_Dont_Make_Secrets_Available_To_Forked_Builds``` control has been changed to fail only for builds which use public forked repos with ‘make secrets available’ checked.
    * The following ALT-account related controls now perform Graph queries to resolve group membership:
        * ```ADO_Organization_AuthN_Use_ALT_Accounts_For_Admin```
        * ```ADO_Project_AuthN_Use_ALT_Accounts_For_Admin```

* Control Name Changes:
    * The following control ids were changed to ensure consistent control names across different resource types for similar controls:

        |Old Control id |New Control Id|
        |---------------|--------------|
        |ADO_VariableGroup_AuthZ_Dont_Grant_All_Pipelines_Access|                   ADO_VariableGroup_AuthZ_Dont_Grant_All_Pipelines_Access_To_Secrets |
