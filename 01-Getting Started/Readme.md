## Import ADO module
Firstly ADO module should be imported in the powershell session before using the scan commands. To import ADO module run below command.
```PowerShell
Import-Module AzSK.ADO
```
## Begin scanning your Organisation and Project

Run the command below after replacing `<OrganizationName>` with your Azure DevOps org Name 
and `<PRJ1, PRJ2, ..`> with a comma-separated list of project names where your Azure DevOps resources are hosted.
You will get Organization name from your ADO organization url e.g. http://sampleadoorg.visualstudio.com. In this 'sampleadoorg' is org name.

```PowerShell
Get-AzSKADOSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "<OrganizationName>" -ProjectNames "<PRJ1, PRJ2,...etc.>"
```

The outcome of the security scan/analysis is printed on the console during SVT execution and a CSV and LOG files are 
also generated for subsequent use.

The CSV file and LOG file are generated under a org-specific sub-folder in the folder  
*%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\AzSK.ADOLogs\Org_[yourOrganizationName]*  
E.g.  
C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\AzSK.ADOLogs\Org_[yourOrganizationName]\20181218_103136_GADS

Refer [doc](../02-Secure-Development#understand-the-scan-reports) for understanding the scan report and [link](./ControlCoverage) for current control coverage for Azure DevOps

To scan large number of project component (more then 1000 resources default value), you need to supply an additional switch parameter -AllowLongRunningScan in the command.
```PowerShell
Get-AzSKADOSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "<OrganizationName>" -ProjectNames "<PRJ1, PRJ2,...etc.>" -AllowLongRunningScan
```
Allowing scan for more then 1000 resources can be configured through the organization policy by updating 'IsAllowLongRunningScan' and 'LongRunningScanCheckPoint' properties in the ControlSettings.json file. 
If 'IsAllowLongRunningScan' is set to true, then by using '-AllowLongRunningScan' switch parameter, AzSK.ADO allows scan for resources count which is set in 'LongRunningScanCheckPoint'. If 'IsAllowLongRunningScan' value is set to false it does not allow scan for more then resources count set in 'LongRunningScanCheckPoint'.
