<br/>
Granting minimum access ensures that PAT is granted with just enough permissions to perform required tasks. This minimizes exposure of the resources in case of PAT compromise.

<tr><td><b>Personal access tokens (PAT) must have a shortest possible validity period</b>
<br/>
If a personal access token (PAT) gets compromised, the Azure DevOps assets accessible to the user can be accessed/manipulated by unauthorized users. Minimizing the validity period of the PAT ensures that the window of time available to an attacker in the event of compromise is small.
