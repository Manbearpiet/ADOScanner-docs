# AzSK.ADO PowerShell module

At its core, the Security Scanner for ADO is a PowerShell module. This can be run locally from the PS console after installation. This is as simple as running PS in non-Admin mode and running the cmds as shown below:

## Installation Guide

>**Pre-requisites**:
> - PowerShell 5.0 or higher. 

1. First verify that prerequisites are already installed:  
    Ensure that you have PowerShell version 5.0 or higher by typing **$PSVersionTable** in the PowerShell ISE console window and looking at the PSVersion in the output as shown below.) 
 If the PSVersion is older than 5.0, update PowerShell from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54616).

2. Install the Security Scanner for Azure DevOps (AzSK.ADO) PS module:  
	  
```PowerShell
  Install-Module AzSK.ADO -Scope CurrentUser -AllowClobber -Force
```
------------------------------------------------

### Auto Update
As Azure DevOps features evolve and add more security controls, "AzSK.ADO" also evolves every month respecting the latest security features.
It is always recommended to scan your organization with the latest AzSK.ADO module, thus ensuring to evaluate latest security controls that are available through the module.
"AzSK.ADO" module provides different auto update capabilities w.r.t different stages of devops. More details are below:

**Adhoc Scans:**
Users running the older version of AzSK.ADO scan from their local machine will get a warning as shown in the image below.
It would also provide the user with required instructions to upgrade the module.

The users can leverage the auto update feature which has been introduced from the AzSDK.ADO version 1.15.x.
As shown in the image above, user can go with update by running the command below:

```PowerShell
  Set-AzSKADOPolicySettings -AutoUpdate On|Off
```

User needs to close and reopen a fresh session once the command is run.
Going forward, if the latest version of AzSK.ADO is released, then during execution of any AzSK.ADO command it would start the auto update workflow automatically 
as shown in the image below:

Step 1: It would take user consent before it starts the auto update workflow. (1 in the image above) <br/>
Step 2: Users need to close all the displayed PS sessions. Typically open PS sessions would lock the module and fail the installation. (2 in the image above) <br/>
Step 3: Even the current session must be closed. It would again take the user consent before it starts the auto update flow to avoid the loss of any unsaved work. (3 in the image above)

**ADOScanner Extension:**
No impact to default behavior of ADOScanner extension. It always runs the scan with the latest version available in the PS Gallery. 


## Scan your Azure DevOps resources

Run the command below after replacing `<OrganizationName>` with your Azure DevOps org Name 
and `<PRJ1, PRJ2, ..`> with a comma-separated list of project names where your Azure DevOps resources are hosted.
You will get Organization name from your ADO organization url e.g. http://sampleadoorg.visualstudio.com. In this 'sampleadoorg' is org name.

```PowerShell
Get-AzSKADOSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "<OrganizationName>" -ProjectNames "<PRJ1, PRJ2,...etc.>"
```

Command also supports other parameters of filtering resources.
For instance, you can also make use of the 'BuildNames','ReleaseNames' to filter specific resource

```PowerShell

#Scan organization
Get-AzSKADOSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "<OrganizationName>"

#Scan organization and Project
Get-AzSKADOSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "<OrganizationName>" -ProjectNames "<PRJ1,PRJ2,etc>" 

#Scan organization, project and builds
Get-AzSKADOSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "<OrganizationName>" -ProjectNames "PRJ1" -BuildNames "<BLD1, BLD2,...etc.>" 

#Scan organization, project and releases
Get-AzSKADOSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "<OrganizationName>" -ProjectNames "PRJ1" -ReleaseNames "<RLS1, RLS2,...etc.>" 

#Scan organization, project, all builds and releases
Get-AzSKADOSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "<OrganizationName>" -ProjectNames "PRJ1" -BuildNames "*" -ReleaseNames "*" 

#Scan organization, project and service connections
Get-AzSKADOSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "<OrganizationName>" -ProjectNames "PRJ1" -ServiceConnectionNames "<SER1, SER2,...ect.>"

#Scan organization, project and agent pools
Get-AzSKADOSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "<OrganizationName>" -ProjectNames "PRJ1" -AgentPoolNames "<AGP1, AGP2,...etc.>"

#Scan organization, project, all builds, releases, service connectiopns and agent pools
Get-AzSKADOSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "<OrganizationName>" -ProjectNames "PRJ1" -BuildNames "*" -ReleaseNames "*" -ServiceConnectionNames "*" -AgentPoolNames "*"

#Scan all supported artifacts
Get-AzSKADOSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "<OrganizationName>" -ScanAllArtifacts

#Scan projects 
Get-AzSKADOSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "<OrganizationName>" -ProjectNames "<PRJ1,PRJ2,etc>" -ResourceTypeName Project

#Scan builds 
Get-AzSKADOSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "<OrganizationName>" -ProjectNames "PRJ1" -BuildNames "*" -ResourceTypeName Build

#Scan releases 
Get-AzSKADOSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "<OrganizationName>" -ProjectNames "PRJ1" -ReleaseNames "*" -ResourceTypeName Release

#Scan service connections 
Get-AzSKADOSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "<OrganizationName>" -ProjectNames "PRJ1" -ServiceConnectionNames "*" -ResourceTypeName ServiceConnection

#Scan agent pools 
Get-AzSKADOSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "<OrganizationName>" -ProjectNames "PRJ1" -AgentPoolNames "*" -ResourceTypeName AgentPool

#Scan resources for baseline controls only
Get-AzSKADOSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "<OrganizationName>" -ProjectNames "<PRJ1,PRJ2,etc>" -ubc

#Scan resources with severity
Get-AzSKADOSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "<OrganizationName>" -ProjectNames "<PRJ1,PRJ2,etc>" -Severity "High/Medium/Low"
```

The outcome of the security scan/analysis is printed on the console during SVT execution and a CSV and LOG files are 
also generated for subsequent use.

The CSV file and LOG file are generated under a org-specific sub-folder in the folder  
*%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\AzSK.ADOLogs\Org_[yourOrganizationName]*  
E.g.  
C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Azure.DevOpsLogs\Org_[yourOrganizationName]\20181218_103136_GADS

Refer [doc](../02-Secure-Development#understand-the-scan-reports) for understanding the scan report and [link](./ControlCoverage) for current control coverage for Azure DevOps

To scan large number of project component (more then 1000 resources default value), you need to supply an additional switch parameter -AllowLongRunningScan in the command.
```PowerShell
Get-AzSKADOSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "<OrganizationName>" -ProjectNames "<PRJ1, PRJ2,...etc.>" -AllowLongRunningScan
```
Allowing scan for more then 1000 resources can be configured through the organization policy by updating 'IsAllowLongRunningSca'n and 'LongRunningScanCheckPoint' properties in the ControlSettings.json file. 
If 'IsAllowLongRunningScan' is set to true, then by using '-AllowLongRunningScan' switch parameter, AzSK.ADO allows scan for resources count which is set in 'LongRunningScanCheckPoint'. If 'IsAllowLongRunningScan' value is set to false it does not allow scan for more then resources count set in 'LongRunningScanCheckPoint'.
